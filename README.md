#### Automatic Table and Date Search using JavaScript

* Create a basic HTML web page.
* Using the ufo dataset provided in the form of a JavaScript object, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
* Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.
* Add an input tag to your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
